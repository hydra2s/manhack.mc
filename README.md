# ğŸ’” Manhack (teaser) ğŸ’”

ğŸ’” The new Minecraft rendering mod, based on Vulkan API and Noire.java. Also, this is, probably, final project of and in my life (i.e. finale of my 2023 year). ğŸ’”

## TODO features

- ğŸ’” Hacking engine for Minecraft 1.19.3
- ğŸ’” Fully configurable (like Optifine)
- ğŸ’” Vulkan API 1.3.236 and Noire.java
- ğŸ’” Future of rendering
- ğŸ’” Ray-tracing support
- ğŸ’” Yet another architecture
- ğŸ’” SPIR-V shaders support (unlike a VulkanMod)
- ğŸ’” OpenGL interop (but planned to fully replace)
- ğŸ’” Single draw call instead of bunch of GL calls
- ğŸ’” Sort of NVIDIA Remix or ReShade (better than RTGI)
