# ðŸ’” Manhack (teaser) ðŸ’”

ðŸ’” The new Minecraft rendering mod, based on [Vulkan API](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/) (aka. LWJGL 3.3.2) and [Noire.java](https://github.com/hydra2s/noire.java). Also, this is, probably, final project of and in my life (i.e. finale of my 2023 year). ðŸ’”

## TODO features

- ðŸ’” Hacking engine for Minecraft 1.19.3
- ðŸ’” Fully configurable (like Optifine)
- ðŸ’” [Vulkan API 1.3.236](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/) (aka. LWJGL 3.3.2) and [Noire.java](https://github.com/hydra2s/noire.java)
- ðŸ’” Future of rendering
- ðŸ’” Ray-tracing support (RTX or RDNA>=2 only)
- ðŸ’” Yet another architecture
- ðŸ’” SPIR-V shaders support (unlike a [VulkanMod](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod))
- ðŸ’” OpenGL interop (but planned to fully replace)
- ðŸ’” Single draw call instead of bunch of GL calls
- ðŸ’” Sort of NVIDIA Remix or ReShade (better than RTGI)
- ðŸ’” Replacement for [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris) or [Canvas](https://github.com/vram-guild/canvas)

## Timing of development

ðŸ’” Rather extremely long, could take as long as 2024. Although we and I need to hurry, and do it as fast as we can. The contract is actually up to two years. ðŸ’”
